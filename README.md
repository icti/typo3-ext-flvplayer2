# TYPO3 CMS extension "flvplayer2"

This Video Player allows you to show your MP4 or FLV videos to a broader audience as with Quicktime, Windows Media or Real Media. This extension is based and backwards-compatible with extension flvplayer, adding standards compliance, an updated player (JW Player or Flowplayer) and improved support for YouTube and Vimeo.
